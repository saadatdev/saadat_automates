      longDescription: "I developed a seamless Zapier automation to streamline Stripe payments and invoicing. The system automatically detects whether a customer already exists in Stripe, ensuring efficient customer management. If found, it generates an invoice; if not, it creates a new customer before processing the payment. Additionally, the automation integrates with Keygen to fetch software purchase details, ensuring accurate transaction handling. This setup eliminates manual invoicing, reduces errors, and enhances the overall payment workflow.",

Creating a Webhook URL to trigger whenever a message is received.
Writing a Google Apps Script to handle the webhook call.
Extracting relevant data and adding it as a new row in Google Sheets.
This lightweight and efficient automation ensures reliable data capture without manual intervention. ðŸš€`,

      longDescription: `Overview
    This project involved building a comprehensive content automation system using n8n.
    
    The workflow begins with SEO research, where the DataForSEO API is used to fetch related, suggested, and subtopic keywords. A custom scoring system prioritizes high-value keywords, and all results are organized into Google Sheets for streamlined planning.
    
    Next, the system performs competitor and SERP analysis by scraping the top 10 ranking blogs with Apify and using AI to identify gaps, tone, and structure. The insights are stored in structured content sheets for easy access.
    
    Based on this data, AI generates detailed content briefs that include meta titles, descriptions, H2/H3 outlines, CTAs, and link recommendations, ensuring each blog is optimized before writing begins.
    
    Finally, the workflow drafts complete blog articles, creates AI-generated images, formats them, and automatically publishes the content to WordPress.
    
    This automation reduced the manual effort of research, writing, and publishing, enabling SEO-optimized blogs to be produced consistently and at scale.`,

      title: "AI-Driven Lead Qualification in GoHighLevel",
      description: "Built an automated lead qualification workflow combining GoHighLevel and Make, with AI-driven conversations to filter and qualify leads before handing them to human sales teams.",
      longDescription: `Overview
    This project focused on automating the lead qualification process by integrating GoHighLevel with Make and AI.
    
    When a new lead enters GoHighLevel, the workflow triggers automatically through a webhook and begins a real-time conversation with the prospect. The system retrieves the full conversation history from GHL using its API and sends it to an AI assistant trained on the clientâ€™s business details.
    
    The AI answers questions, provides relevant information, and asks qualifying questions such as budget, service needs, and timeline. If a lead indicates they are not interested, the conversation ends politely, while interested leads are moved into the Qualified Lead stage inside GHL Opportunities.
    
    At that point, the sales team takes over with complete context, since the entire interaction is logged inside GHL.
    
    This automation allowed the client to filter out uninterested leads, engage with prospects instantly, and ensure their sales team only spent time with warm, high-quality opportunities.`,
